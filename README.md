## About me

I am a recent grad majoring in computer science student from [the University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca).

### Programming Projects

Come [here](https://haoyuanli.github.io/projects) to view a list of programming projects that I have been working on. If you are interested, check out how it looked like [previously](https://haoyuanli.github.io/projects_deprecated).

### Besides Coding...

I sometimes [put words together](https://haoyuanli.github.io/articles)!

I like chasing after [typhoons](https://metoc.ndbc.noaa.gov/JTWC/)...

I found that UBC is [so much warmer](http://weather.eos.ubc.ca/wxfcst/users/Guest/ubcrs_withicons/index.php?location=3510) than the [YVR airport](https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/bc-74_metric_e.html)
